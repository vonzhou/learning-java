/*
 * Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
 * For example, this binary tree is symmetric:
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
But the following is not:
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
   Note:
   Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
